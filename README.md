THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO REQUEST MODS OR TO ASK HOW TO USE / INSTALL THEM! Go to Twitter for that (https://twitter.com/tomdevs)

This repo is a collection of scripts for use with BlockLauncher, and therefore, Minecraft Pocket Editon (Android).

You do not have permission to redistrubite or modify any software contained within this github repository without prior written permission from me. This is to stop people directly profiting from taking my mods and putting them in an app with ads, behind an ad riddled link or similar. I will be contacting anyone that is doing this and reporting them to the appropriate organisations (e.g. Google Play in the case of apps which directly profit from my mods).

If you have a suggestion, correction or contribution you are welcome to contact me or send a pull request :)
